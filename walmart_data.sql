STEP 1: CREATE AND USE DATABASE
*/

CREATE DATABASE walmart;

/*
STEP 2: DATA CLEANING â€“ FIX DATE COLUMN FORMAT
*/

-- Check sample data
SELECT * FROM walmart.walmart LIMIT 10;

-- Add a new clean date column
ALTER TABLE walmart.walmart
ADD COLUMN date_clean DATE;

-- Convert text-based date (DD-MM-YYYY) to MySQL DATE format
UPDATE walmart.walmart

-- Verify conversion
SELECT Date, date_clean FROM walmart.walmart LIMIT 10;

-- Drop old text column and rename the new one

STEP 3: STORE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------*/

STEP 4: HOLIDAY IMPACT ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------*/

STEP 5: TIME-BASED SALES ANALYSIS
--------------------------------------------------------------*/

-- Monthly sales per store (identify store-level seasonality)
select store, sum(weekly_sales),
MONTHNAME(Date)

STEP 6: FACTOR-WISE IMPACT ON SALES
--------------------------------------------------------------*/

-- Temperature vs Sales
SELECT

-- Fuel Price vs Sales
SELECT

    END AS Fuel_Range,
    ROUND(AVG(Weekly_Sales), 2) AS Avg_Sales
FROM walmart.walmart
GROUP BY Fuel_Range
ORDER BY Avg_Sales DESC;

-- CPI vs Sales
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN CPI < 200 THEN 'Low'
        WHEN CPI BETWEEN 200 AND 220 THEN 'Medium'
        ELSE 'High'
    END AS CPI_Level,
    ROUND(AVG(Weekly_Sales), 2) AS Avg_Sales

-- Holiday vs Non-Holiday Sales
SELECT
